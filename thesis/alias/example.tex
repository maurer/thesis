\subsection{Inter-procedural Flow-Sensitive Example}
In this section, we provide an example of the context- and flow-
sensitive analysis on a simple example shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:example-c}. To provide clarity on how updating alias
sets work, this example does not show data-flow merges, which is a set
union operation as previously described.

Listing \ref{lst:example-c} contains one real use-after-free bug.  We
also show one location that is safe, but without context-sensitivity
an additional false positive will be raised. Without
context-sensitivity, both the allocations for \texttt{g\_a} and
\texttt{g\_b} get merged, making the analysis believe they are aliased
when they are not.

The corresponding assembly, annotated with comments on the location of
the UaF and alias sets, is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:example-asm}.
Portions of the alias set hilighted in green are new bindings.
Portions in blue are bindings which have been destructively updated.
In the example, the variables are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The stack slots of f (g has none): sp+24@f, sp+16@f, sp+8@f
	\item All used registers (other than the stack): RDI, RAX
	\item Allocations split on sensitivity, using the form dyn@addr\{stack\}
          \begin{itemize}
          \item Context-insensitive: dyn@5 and dyn@13
          \item Context-sensitive: dyn@5\{19\}, dyn@5\{25\}, dyn@13\{\}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The alias sets are annotated as comments. For example, right before
the free on line 35, the alias set is:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{\{ RAX -> dyn@0; sp+24@f -> dyn@1;
    sp+16@f -> dyn@0; sp+8@f -> dyn@0;
    RDI -> dyn@0 \}}
\end{figure}

This shows that \texttt{RDI} is pointing to the memory location \texttt{dyn@1}, the allocation site for \texttt{x} in the source code.
Right after the \texttt{free} on line 35, the alias set changes to show \texttt{dyn@1} is now free.
The UAF detector would say any pointer that resolves to \texttt{dyn@1} is therefore a use-after-free bug, which happens on
line 53.

If we had been context-sensitive, the points-to relation at 59, the false positive, would instead be
\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{\{ RAX -> dyn@5\{25\}; sp+24@f -> dyn@13\{\};
    sp+16@f -> dyn@5\{19\}; sp+8@f -> dyn@5\{25\};
    RDI -> dyn@5\{19\}; dyn@13\{\} -> free@35;
    dyn@5\{19\} -> free@43 \}}
\end{figure}

The key difference here is that \texttt{RAX} points to \texttt{dyn@5\{25\}} rather than just \texttt{dyn@5}, so we can distinguish it from the freed allocation.
This allows context sensitivity to weed out more false positives.
