\section{Conclusion}
\label{tach:sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented \tachyon, a system for testing binary-only
patches on real inputs in a live system. We have demonstrated an
efficient way to describe interface boundaries on C-style declarations
using a lightweight dependent type system.  Our experiments show
\tachyon is able to automatically detect deviations on real
programs. We also suggest our techniques may apply to other problem
domains, such as honeypots.
