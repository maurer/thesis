%  First something or other (narrow until you've got it)
\bitr\ forms the first type recovery system able to recover \emph{recursive}, \emph{polymorphic}, and \emph{structure} types from compiled code.
%  Real Problem
Type reconstruction is a real problem encountered in a variety of areas, ranging from debugging of foreign code to decompilation and analysis.
%  We made a tool to deal with it
In this paper, we have shown that \bitr\ recovers types in a fashion which is both more accurate and specific than previous work. \bitr\ accomplishes this by applying techniques inspired by the field of programming languages. Finally, by being a general type system, \bitr\ forms a way of looking at type recovery that is more extensible and applicable to a wider variety of problems.
