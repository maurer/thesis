% Implement Holmes
% * Logic server/backing
% * Analyses
%   * CFG (pure holmes?)
%   * VSA
%   * BiTR
%   * Fuzz
%   * Alias (TODO decide which)

% Verify Reasoning over Holmes
% * Proof of monotonicity of aggregators
% * Soundness of hypothetical circumscription
% * (Optional/extension) Subset which terminates

% Quantify interactions between analyses
% * Measure improvements from integrating analyses over traditional implementations
% * Meaure the marginal improvements from each interaction
% * Look to see if any of the improvements are greater than the sum of their parts
