% General motivation
% * Bulk of software is binary only
% * Need more powerful inspection capabilities
%
% * Existing approaches are not integrated
% * Existing approaches play fast and loose with soundness/assumptions
% * When approaches are integrated, effort is being wasted on reimplementation
%
% * Can a tailored logic language solve this problem?

% Past work sets the stage for / encourages this 
% * Datalog/prolog as a binary analysis tool
%   * Shows fact-like representation of program properties is feasible
%     * TODO Examples?
%   * Natural way to describe incremental information buildup
%     * TODO Examples of incrementality
% * Analysis Integration improved results
%   * Jakstab
%   * TODO another example
% * Analysis soundness-failure
%   * TODO examples

% Thesis Statement
% * Logic language
%   * Powerful enough to express integration of binary analyses
%     * Aggregation - allows consumption of non-fixed numbers of facts
%     * Circumscription - allows reasoning based on incomplete information
%   * Can be reasoned about
%     * Monotonicity - truth is immutable
% * Binary analysis integration
%   * Is simpler with Holmes
%   * Provides result quality improvements
The Holmes logic language provides a method of expressing the integration of codependent interacting analyses.
Programs written in Holmes are powerful enough to perform traditional binary analyses by allowing circumscription and aggregation, yet maintain monotonic reasoning properties.
Binary analyses combined via Holmes are simpler to write than their directly integrated counterparts, and produce higher quality results when integrated than when separate.

% Roadmap to defending the thesis statement
% * Show the power by
%   * Implementing the integration of several real analyses using the language
%   * Attempting to do so without using circumscription or aggregation, and seeing what happens.
% * Show it can be reasoned about by
%   * Proving formally the monotonicity of
%     * Aggregation with our restrictions
%     * Circumscription with our restrictions
%   * Attempting to slice out a restricted segment which is terminating
% * Show result improvement by
%   * Measuring integrated/unintegrated analyses against ground truth on several tasks
%     * CFG recovery
%     * Value analysis
%     * Type recovery
%     * Alias analysis

% Contribution Summary
% * Monotonic aggregators
% * Hypothetical circumscription
% * Study of interaction between binary analysis techniques
% * Practical system implementation
