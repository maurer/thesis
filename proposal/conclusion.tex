I propose to complete development and implementation of \sysname\ and sample applications.
I expect to find that \sysname\ improves the ease of integration of multiple analyses, allows for simpler incremental analysis, and improves the performance both in resource consumption and quality.
I will test this by implementing and integrating existing binary analysis techniques via \sysname\ and comparing the performance of the resulting system.
Additionally, I intend to produce an analysis of which queries made against the forward fragment of \sysname\ will terminate.
I will approach the termination analysis by attempting to write a formal proof of the property in the cases I can encompass.

If work goes well, I intend to explore extensions to \sysname\ and more complex evaluation strategies as a stretch goal.
Specific extensions of interest are retraction and circumscription.
For evaluation strategies, I am considering a tactics and ML-based approaches to evaluation.
