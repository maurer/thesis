@misc{McAllester,
abstract = {This paper argues that for many algorithms, and static analysis algorithms in particular, bottom-up logic program presentations are clearer and simpler to analyze, for both correctness and complexity, than classical pseudo-code presentations. The main technical contribution consists of two theorems which allow, in many cases, the asymptotic running time of a bottom-up logic program to be determined by inspection. It is well known that a datalog program runs in O(nk) time where k is the largest number of free variables in any single rule. The theorems given here are significantly more refined. A variety of algorithms are presented and analyzed as examples.},

@inproceedings{Lam2005a,
abstract = {Program analysis has been increasingly used in software engineering tasks such as auditing programs for security vulnerabilities and finding errors in general. Such tools often require analyses much more sophisticated than those traditionally used in compiler optimizations. In particular, context-sensitive pointer alias information is a prerequisite for any sound and precise analysis that reasons about uses of heap objects in a program. Context-sensitive analysis is challenging because there are over 1014 contexts in a typical large program, even after recursive cycles are collapsed. Moreover, pointers cannot be resolved in general without analyzing the entire program. This paper presents a new framework, based on the concept of deductive databases, for context-sensitive program analysis. In this framework, all program information is stored as relations; data access and analyses are written as Datalog queries. To handle the large number of contexts in a program, the database represents relations with binary decision diagrams (BDDs). The system we have developed, called bddbddb, automatically translates database queries into highly optimized BDD programs. Our preliminary experiences suggest that a large class of analyses involving heap objects can be described succinctly in Datalog and implemented efficiently with BDDs. To make developing application-specific analyses easy for programmers, we have also created a language called PQL that makes a subset of Datalog queries more intuitive to define. We have used the language to find many security holes in Web applications.},
